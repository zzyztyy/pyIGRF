Description: # pyIGRF
        ## What is pyIGRF?  
        This is a package of IGRF-12 (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) about python version.
        It don't need any Fortran compiler. But it needs numpy.
        ## How to Install?
        Download this package and run install.
        >```python setup.py install```
        
        ## How to Use it?
        First import this package.  
        > ```import pyIGRF```
        
        You can calculate magnetic field intensity.   
        >```pyIGRF.igrf_value(lat, lon, alt, date)```
        
        or calculate the annual variation of magnetic filed intensity.  
        >```pyIGRF.igrf_variation(lat, lon, alt, date)```
        
        If you want to use IGRF-12 more flexible, you can use module *calculate*. 
        There is two function which is closer to Fortran. You can change it for different coordination.
        >```from pyIGRF import calculate```  
        
        Another module *loadCoeffs* can be used to get *g[m][n]* or *h[m][n]* same as that in formula.
        >```from pyIGRF.loadCoeffs import getCoeffs``` 
        
        the response is 7 float number about magnetic filed which is:  
        - D: declination (+ve east)
        - I: inclination (+ve down)
        - H: horizontal intensity
        - X: north component
        - Y: east component
        - Z: vertical component (+ve down)
        - F: total intensity  
        *unit: degree or nT*
